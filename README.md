# Financial Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques on a dataset containing over 6 million transaction records.

## Objective
Build a predictive model to identify fraudulent transactions and generate insights for fraud prevention.

## Data Processing
- Handled missing values and outliers  
- Reduced multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)  
- Performed feature engineering using balance difference variables  
- Encoded categorical transaction types  

## Model & Evaluation
Supervised classification models were trained and evaluated using:

- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- ROC-AUC  

## Key Insights
- Fraud occurs more frequently in transfer and cash-out transactions  
- Large balance differences are strong fraud indicators  

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
