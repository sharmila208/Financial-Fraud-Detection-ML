# 💳 Financial Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

🚀 A machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using large-scale transaction data.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
Financial fraud is a major challenge in digital banking and payment systems.  
This project builds a predictive machine learning model to identify fraudulent transactions and help organizations prevent financial losses.

---

## 🎯 Objective
✅ Detect fraudulent transactions  
✅ Analyze fraud behavior patterns  
✅ Provide actionable business prevention strategies  

---

## 📊 Dataset Information
- 📁 6+ Million Transaction Records  
- 🔢 10 Features  
- 💰 Includes transaction amount, balance details, transaction type, and fraud indicators  

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- ✔ Missing value handling  
- ✔ Outlier detection and treatment  
- ✔ Multicollinearity reduction using **VIF**  
- ✔ Feature engineering using balance difference variables  
- ✔ Categorical encoding

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
Supervised classification models were trained and evaluated using:

- 🎯 Precision  
- 🔍 Recall  
- 📈 F1 Score  
- 📊 ROC-AUC Score  

---

## 🔎 Key Insights
- Fraud is more frequent in **Transfer** and **Cash-Out** transactions  
- Sudden large balance changes strongly indicate fraudulent behavior  
- Fraud transactions follow identifiable transaction patterns  

---

## 🛡 Business Recommendations
- Implement real-time fraud monitoring  
- Apply behavioral risk analysis  
- Strengthen verification for high-value transactions  
- Deploy automated fraud alert systems
